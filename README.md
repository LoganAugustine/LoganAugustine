# Truss FEA Program for AERO 306 - Structural Analysis II (Python)This program will calculate the deflection of a truss structure with a given orientation and applied force. The user will create a detailed input file with nodal coordinates, information on the elements of the truss, and the forces involved. With this file, the program will output a visual plot of the original truss, and then a plot of the deformation of the truss. This program was created for my final project for AERO 306 - Structural Analysis II at Texas A&M University. This code can be used to perform Finite Element Analysis for any truss, so long as it is correctly defined in the input file, which I will provide detailed instructions for.
